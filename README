## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x:**
    *   This project is developed with Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.13 or specify your version).
    *   Ensure Python is installed and accessible from your command line. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use a package manager like Homebrew (`brew install python`).

2.  **Graphviz (System Installation):**
    *   **Crucial Prerequisite:** The Graphviz software suite must be installed on your system. This provides the `dot` command-line tool, which is essential for generating graph visualizations used in this project (e.g., for AND-trees). The Python `graphviz` package (listed in `requirements.txt`) is an interface to this system-level installation.
    *   **Installation Instructions:**
        *   **macOS (using Homebrew):**
            ```bash
            brew install graphviz
            ```
        *   **Linux (e.g., Debian/Ubuntu):**
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install graphviz
            ```
        *   **Windows:** Download the installer from the [Graphviz official website](https://graphviz.org/download/#windows). During installation, ensure you opt to add Graphviz to the system PATH.
        *   **Other Systems:** Please refer to the [Graphviz Download Page](https://graphviz.org/download/#executable-packages).
    *   **Verification:** After installation, open a **new** terminal window/tab and run the command:
        ```bash
        dot -V
        ```
        This should print the version of Graphviz installed (e.g., `dot - graphviz version X.Y.Z ...`). If the command is not found, ensure Graphviz's `bin` directory is in your system's PATH environment variable.

3.  **C Preprocessor / C Compiler (for `pycparser`):**
    *   The `pycparser` Python package, used for parsing C code, requires a C preprocessor (e.g., `cpp`) and a C compiler (e.g., `gcc` or `clang`) to be available in your system's PATH.
    *   **Installation Instructions:**
        *   **macOS:** Usually available via Xcode Command Line Tools. If not installed, run:
            ```bash
            xcode-select --install
            ```
        *   **Linux (e.g., Debian/Ubuntu):**
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install build-essential
            ```
        *   **Windows:** Typically installed with a C compiler suite like MinGW-w64 or MSVC (Visual Studio). Ensure the compiler's `bin` directory is in the PATH.
