To Do:
1. convert the c file into tac. 🎀
2. run script to inline the c file. 🎀
3. run and_cloud generator to get the and tree. 🎀
4. generate the gadget defintion for the d order security. 🎀
5. get the area and latency of each gadget.
6. generate the dict for each gadget area latnecy and randomness
7. run mlrc and mrlc to get the optimisation gadget placement
8. replace the and operation with the gadgets
9. pass this file to maskedHLS



TASK1: 
CORRECT UTILITY.PY


TASK 2

1. correct the and_cloud module 

TASK 3
1. verify test bench generation module

TASK 4
1. MLRC ✅
2. MRLC ✅

# Work done in maskedHLS
- REMOVED ERROR:
- Unable to handle files with only one function definition.
- As the inliner module would remove the function with indegree = 0 so a ast containing just one function definition will be empty.


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
TO DO:

Need to fix the area and latency and randomness in the gadget.

1. randomness for each gadget have a formula
2. latnecy is constant for each of the gadget
3. area is computed through design compiler
 The area needs to be computed using the design compiler 
 How to run a design compiler:

1. login to the server.
2. enter the password 
3. modify the file

 check if the table is populated correclty
