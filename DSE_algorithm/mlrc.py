MINIMISE LATENCY UNDER RANDOMNESS CONSTRAINT.
latnecy = number of levels in and-tree * inital gadget placement assuming hpc2.
randomess = randomness used by each node in the and-tree.


[input] = target_randomness (it tell the maximum limit of randomness that can be used by the design)

[Motivation] : if the randomness is more than needed the we can use this extra randomness to replace the gadgets.

- if the security order (d) = 1
    - randomness used by HPC2 = 1.
    - Therefore, least possible randomness of the design = number of nodes in the and-tree.

        - If {target_randomness} < {number of node in the and-tree}: 
            * use Comar (as it uses only 6 randomness)
            * Initially all the gadgets are COMAR.
            * latency = Number of levels in the and-tree * latency of comar gadget (2)
            * run MLRC to replace gadgets at each level 
        - Else if {target_randomness} >= number of nodes in and-tree.
            * Initially all the gadgets are HPC2. 
            * latency = Number of levels in the and-tree * latency of comar gadget (2)
            * run MLRC to replace gadgets at each level 
            

- for security order > 1:

    - Initially assuming all the nodes are assigned hpc2 gadget.
    - total randomness = number of nodes in the and tree * randomness used per hpc2 gadget of nth order.
